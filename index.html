        <p class="intro-text">
            Genetic Adaptation refers to the change in biological characteristics in a species over long periods of time
            due to the species' environment. The point of these changes is to aid the species to 
            survive better and more safely reproduce. This website will take a look at some of the more common and most important adptations for humans.
             The types of adaptations will be divided into two sections: Genetic and Cultural adaptations

        <p class="genetic-adaptation-intro">
            Genetic adaptations are present in all species as an evolutionary response. Genetic adaptation happens in populations and occurs over several generations. The
            reason these adaptations occur are to boost survivability aswell as to increase reproductivity.
            These changes are irreversible meaning, once a species has adapted they cannot revert. As the name implies as well, these changes occur within the genes
            of a species.

            <h3>UV Radiation</h3>
            <p>
                Humans have developed varying skin pigmentation as a result of exposure to UV radiation. Darker skin, rich in melanin, protects against the harmful effects of UV radiation, including skin cancer and folate degradation, and is prevalent in areas closer to the equator with high UV levels.

            <h3>Body Hair</h3>
            <p>
                Humans have undergone a significant genetic adaptation in relation to body hair. Unlike their hairy ancestors, 
                today's humans have significantly reduced body hair compared to their ancestors. 
                As humans evolved, the loss of body hair provided several advantages. It allowed for better body cooling, in form of sweating.
                Additionally, reduced body hair helped early humans in avoiding parasites and provided better sensitivity to touch. 
                I personally believe as well that clothing being a cultural adaptation may have also supported humans shedding their hair if 
                the human ancestors were developing and wearing clothes.

            <h3>Lactose Intolerance</h3>
            <p>
                Lactose tolerance/intolerance is an interesting case of genetic adaptation in human populations. Most mammals, including early humans, lose their ability to digest lactose after weaning. However, in cultures where dairy farming became prevalent, a genetic mutation allowing lactose digestion to continue into adulthood became advantageous and spread through those populations.

        <h1 class="adaptation-header">Cultural Adaptations</h1>
        <p>
            Culturual adaptations are unique to humans. 
        </p>
        <div class="cultural-adaptation-examples">
            <h3>Clothing</h3>
            <p>
                Humans use clothing as a cultural adaptation to various climates. For instance, the Inuit people use fur clothing to insulate against the cold, while desert-dwelling cultures often wear loose, light-colored clothing to reflect sunlight and aid cooling.

            <h3>Shelter</h3>
            <p>
                Shelter is another way humans adapt culturally. People in colder regions might build insulated homes with heating systems, while those in hot, dry climates often build houses with natural cooling designs, using materials that help to regulate temperature.

            <h3>Tools</h3>
            <p>
                Humans have been using tools for hundreds of thousands of years to adapt to their environments. This ranges from the use of fire and simple stone tools by our early ancestors to the complex technological innovations we see today.
